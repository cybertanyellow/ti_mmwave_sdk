By contrast,<BR>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.<BR><BR>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<BR><BR>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous versions.<BR><BR>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<BR><BR>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>  0. Definitions.<BR><BR>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<BR><BR>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as semiconductor masks.<BR><BR>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<BR><BR>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<BR><BR>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the Program.<BR><BR>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<BR><BR>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<BR><BR>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<BR><BR>  1. Source Code.<BR><BR>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a work.<BR><BR>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers working in that language.<BR><BR>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the work.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same work.<BR><BR>  2. Basic Permissions.<BR><BR>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<BR><BR>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<BR><BR>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it unnecessary.<BR><BR>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<BR><BR>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.<BR><BR>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.<BR><BR>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<BR><BR>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<BR><BR>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<BR><BR>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<BR>    it, and giving a relevant date.<BR><BR>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<BR>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<BR>    "keep intact all notices".<BR><BR>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<BR>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<BR>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<BR>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<BR>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<BR><BR>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<BR>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<BR>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<BR>    work need not make them do so.<BR><BR>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<BR>parts of the aggregate.<BR><BR>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:<BR><BR>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<BR>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<BR>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<BR>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<BR>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<BR>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<BR>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<BR><BR>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<BR>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<BR>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>    with subsection 6b.<BR><BR>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<BR>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<BR>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<BR>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<BR>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<BR>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<BR>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<BR>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<BR>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<BR><BR>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<BR>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<BR>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<BR>    charge under subsection 6d.<BR><BR>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying the object code work.<BR><BR>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.<BR><BR>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.<BR><BR>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<BR>been installed in ROM).<BR><BR>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<BR>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across the network.<BR><BR>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<BR>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<BR>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<BR>unpacking, reading or copying.<BR><BR>  7. Additional Terms.<BR><BR>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<BR><BR>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<BR><BR>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<BR>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<BR><BR>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<BR>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<BR>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<BR><BR>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<BR>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<BR>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<BR><BR>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<BR>    authors of the material; or<BR><BR>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<BR>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<BR><BR>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<BR>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<BR>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<BR>    those licensors and authors.<BR><BR>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<BR><BR>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable terms.<BR><BR>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements apply either way.<BR><BR>  8. Termination.<BR><BR>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 11).<BR><BR>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<BR><BR>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.<BR><BR>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 10.<BR><BR>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<BR><BR>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<BR>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<BR><BR>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<BR><BR>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<BR><BR>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<BR><BR>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<BR>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<BR><BR>  11. Patents.<BR><BR>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<BR>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<BR><BR>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<BR><BR>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the party.<BR><BR>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<BR><BR>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<BR>work and works based on it.<BR><BR>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<BR><BR>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<BR><BR>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<BR><BR>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<BR><BR>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.<BR><BR>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<BR>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the Program.<BR><BR>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.<BR><BR>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<BR><BR>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<BR>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<BR>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<BR>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<BR>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<BR>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. Limitation of Liability.<BR><BR>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<BR>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<BR>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<BR>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<BR>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<BR>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<BR>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<BR>SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<BR><BR>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<BR>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<BR>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<BR>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<BR>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<BR>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<BR>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    &ltprogram>  Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<BR>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<BR><BR>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<BR>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<BR>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<BR>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<BR>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<BR>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.<BR><BR><BR><BR>		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>		       Version 2.1, February 1999<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<BR> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<BR> the version number 2.1.]<BR><BR>			    Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR><BR>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<BR>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<BR>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<BR>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<BR>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<BR>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<BR>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<BR>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<BR>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<BR>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<BR>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<BR>these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<BR>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<BR>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<BR>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<BR>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<BR>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<BR>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR><BR>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<BR>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<BR>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<BR>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<BR>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<BR>introduced by others.<BR> <BR>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<BR>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<BR>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<BR>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<BR>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<BR>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<BR><BR>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<BR>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<BR>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<BR>libraries into non-free programs.<BR><BR>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<BR>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<BR>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<BR>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<BR>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<BR>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<BR>the library.<BR><BR>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<BR>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<BR>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<BR>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<BR>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<BR>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<BR>special circumstances.<BR><BR>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<BR>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<BR>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<BR>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<BR>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<BR>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<BR>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<BR>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<BR>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<BR>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<BR>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<BR>system.<BR><BR>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<BR>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<BR>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<BR>that program using a modified version of the Library.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<BR>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<BR>be combined with the library in order to run.<BR> <BR>		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<BR>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<BR>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<BR>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<BR>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<BR><BR>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR><BR>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<BR>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<BR><BR>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>and installation of the library.<BR><BR>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR>  <BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<BR>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>fee.<BR> <BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR><BR>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Library.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>these notices.<BR> <BR>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR><BR>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR><BR>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<BR>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<BR>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<BR>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR><BR>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<BR>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR><BR>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR><BR>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR> <BR>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<BR>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<BR>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR><BR>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>of these things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<BR>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>    to use the modified definitions.)<BR><BR>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<BR>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<BR>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<BR>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<BR>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<BR>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<BR><BR>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR><BR>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>    specified materials from the same place.<BR><BR>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR><BR>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<BR>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<BR>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>the executable.<BR><BR>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>distribute.<BR> <BR>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>    Sections above.<BR><BR>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Library or works based on it.<BR><BR>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<BR>this License.<BR> <BR>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<BR>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.<BR> <BR>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>			    NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<BR>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<BR>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<BR>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<BR>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<BR>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<BR>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<BR>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<BR>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<BR>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<BR>DAMAGES.<BR><BR>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR> <BR>           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR><BR>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>ordinary General Public License).<BR><BR>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<BR>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<BR>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<BR>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<BR>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<BR>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<BR>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<BR>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<BR>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<BR>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<BR>rights.<BR><BR>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<BR>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<BR>distribute and/or modify the software.<BR><BR>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<BR>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<BR>authors' reputations.<BR><BR>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<BR>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<BR>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<BR>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR> <BR>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<BR>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<BR>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<BR>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<BR>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<BR>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<BR>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<BR>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<BR><BR>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR><BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<BR>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>along with the Program.<BR><BR>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<BR><BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>    parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<BR>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<BR>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<BR>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<BR>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<BR>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<BR>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<BR>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<BR> <BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Program.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<BR>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<BR>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<BR>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<BR>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<BR>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<BR><BR>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<BR>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<BR>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<BR>itself accompanies the executable.<BR><BR>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR> <BR>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<BR>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Program or works based on it.<BR><BR>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Program at all.

In such case, this License incorporates<BR>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the General Public License from time to time.

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<BR>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<BR>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>			    NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<BR>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<BR>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.

You can use it for<BR>your libraries, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<BR>you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<BR>complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<BR>with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<BR>the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<BR>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR><BR>  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<BR>version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<BR>the original authors' reputations.<BR> <BR>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<BR>software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<BR>transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<BR>we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<BR>free use or not licensed at all.<BR><BR>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<BR>GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<BR>license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<BR>designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<BR>one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<BR>the same as in the ordinary license.<BR><BR>  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<BR>they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<BR>program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<BR>changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<BR>analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<BR>a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<BR>derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<BR>treats it as such.<BR><BR>  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<BR>Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<BR>sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<BR>concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<BR><BR>  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<BR>users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<BR>libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<BR>permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<BR>preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<BR>libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<BR>this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<BR>changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<BR>will lead to faster development of free libraries.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<BR>former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<BR>works together with the library.<BR><BR>  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<BR>General Public License rather than by this special one.<BR> <BR>		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<BR>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<BR>party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<BR>General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<BR>addressed as "you".<BR><BR>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR><BR>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<BR>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<BR><BR>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>and installation of the library.<BR><BR>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR>  <BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<BR>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>fee.<BR> <BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR><BR>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Library.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>these notices.<BR> <BR>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR><BR>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR><BR>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<BR>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<BR>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<BR>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR><BR>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<BR>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR><BR>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR><BR>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR> <BR>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<BR>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<BR>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR><BR>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>of these things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<BR>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>    to use the modified definitions.)<BR><BR>    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR><BR>    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>    specified materials from the same place.<BR><BR>    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR><BR>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<BR>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<BR>distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>the executable.<BR><BR>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>distribute.<BR> <BR>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>    Sections above.<BR><BR>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Library or works based on it.<BR><BR>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this License.<BR> <BR>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<BR>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.<BR> <BR>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>			    NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<BR>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<BR>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<BR>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<BR>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<BR>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<BR>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<BR>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<BR>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<BR>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<BR>DAMAGES.<BR><BR>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR> <BR>     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR><BR>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>ordinary General Public License).<BR><BR>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<BR>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<BR>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<BR><BR>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<BR>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<BR>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<BR>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<BR>version:<BR><BR>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<BR>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<BR>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<BR>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<BR><BR>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<BR>   this License applicable to that copy.<BR><BR>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<BR><BR>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<BR>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<BR>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<BR>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<BR>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<BR>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<BR>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>  4. Combined Works.<BR><BR>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<BR>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<BR>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<BR>the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<BR>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<BR>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<BR>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<BR>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<BR><BR>   d) Do one of the following:<BR><BR>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<BR>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<BR>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<BR>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<BR>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<BR>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<BR>       Corresponding Source.<BR><BR>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<BR>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<BR>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<BR>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<BR>       Version. <BR><BR>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<BR>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<BR>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<BR>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<BR>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<BR>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<BR>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<BR>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<BR><BR>  5. Combined Libraries.<BR><BR>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<BR>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<BR>choice, if you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<BR>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<BR>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<BR>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<BR>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<BR>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<BR>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<BR>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<BR>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<BR>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<BR>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<BR>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<BR>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<BR>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<BR>Library.<BR><BR><BR>Component binutils/libdecnumber:<BR>--------------------------------<BR><BR>   This file is part of GCC.<BR><BR>   GCC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under<BR>   the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free<BR>   Software Foundation; either version 3, or (at your option) any later<BR>   version.<BR><BR>   GCC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY<BR>   WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or<BR>   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<BR>bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<BR>the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<BR><BR>When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<BR>certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<BR>program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<BR>non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<BR>header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<BR><BR>0. Definitions.<BR><BR>A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<BR>Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<BR>interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<BR>on the Runtime Library.<BR><BR>"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<BR>modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<BR>the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<BR>subsequent versions published by the FSF.<BR><BR>"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<BR>modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<BR>the license of GCC.<BR><BR>"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<BR>target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<BR>input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<BR>phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<BR>format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<BR>for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<BR><BR>The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<BR>non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<BR>Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<BR>use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<BR>part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<BR>understood as starting with the output of the generators or<BR>preprocessors.<BR><BR>A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<BR>with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<BR>work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<BR>optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<BR>Eligible Compilation Process.<BR><BR>1. Grant of Additional Permission.<BR><BR>You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<BR>combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<BR>propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<BR>all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<BR>may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<BR>consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<BR><BR>2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<BR><BR>The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<BR>presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<BR>requirements of the license of GCC.<BR><BR><BR>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lthttp://fsf.org/><BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>                            Preamble<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<BR>software and other kinds of works.<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<BR>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<BR>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.<BR><BR>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<BR><BR>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous versions.<BR><BR>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<BR><BR>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>  0. Definitions.<BR><BR>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<BR><BR>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as semiconductor masks.<BR><BR>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<BR><BR>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<BR><BR>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the Program.<BR><BR>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<BR><BR>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<BR><BR>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<BR><BR>  1. Source Code.<BR><BR>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a work.<BR><BR>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers working in that language.<BR><BR>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the work.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same work.<BR><BR>  2. Basic Permissions.<BR><BR>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<BR><BR>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<BR><BR>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it unnecessary.<BR><BR>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<BR><BR>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.<BR><BR>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.<BR><BR>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<BR><BR>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<BR><BR>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<BR><BR>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<BR>    it, and giving a relevant date.<BR><BR>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<BR>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<BR>    "keep intact all notices".<BR><BR>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<BR>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<BR>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<BR>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<BR>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<BR><BR>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<BR>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<BR>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<BR>    work need not make them do so.<BR><BR>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<BR>parts of the aggregate.<BR><BR>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:<BR><BR>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<BR>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<BR>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<BR>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<BR>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<BR>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<BR>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<BR><BR>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<BR>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<BR>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>    with subsection 6b.<BR><BR>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<BR>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<BR>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<BR>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<BR>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<BR>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<BR>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<BR>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<BR>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<BR><BR>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<BR>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<BR>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<BR>    charge under subsection 6d.<BR><BR>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying the object code work.<BR><BR>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.<BR><BR>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.<BR><BR>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<BR>been installed in ROM).<BR><BR>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<BR>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across the network.<BR><BR>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<BR>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<BR>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<BR>unpacking, reading or copying.<BR><BR>  7. Additional Terms.<BR><BR>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<BR><BR>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<BR><BR>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<BR>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<BR><BR>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<BR>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<BR>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<BR><BR>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<BR>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<BR>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<BR><BR>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<BR>    authors of the material; or<BR><BR>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<BR>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<BR><BR>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<BR>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<BR>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<BR>    those licensors and authors.<BR><BR>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<BR><BR>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable terms.<BR><BR>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements apply either way.<BR><BR>  8. Termination.<BR><BR>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 11).<BR><BR>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<BR><BR>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.<BR><BR>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 10.<BR><BR>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<BR><BR>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<BR>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<BR><BR>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<BR><BR>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<BR><BR>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<BR><BR>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<BR>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<BR><BR>  11. Patents.<BR><BR>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<BR>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<BR><BR>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<BR><BR>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the party.<BR><BR>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<BR><BR>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<BR>work and works based on it.<BR><BR>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<BR><BR>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<BR><BR>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<BR><BR>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<BR><BR>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.<BR><BR>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<BR>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the Program.<BR><BR>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.<BR><BR>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<BR><BR>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<BR>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<BR>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<BR>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<BR>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<BR>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. Limitation of Liability.<BR><BR>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<BR>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<BR>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<BR>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<BR>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<BR>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<BR>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<BR>SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<BR><BR>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<BR>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<BR>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<BR>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<BR>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<BR>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<BR>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    &ltprogram>  Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<BR>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<BR><BR>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<BR>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<BR>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<BR>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<BR>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<BR>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.<BR><BR><BR>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>		       Version 2, June 1991<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>			    Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<BR>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<BR>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<BR>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<BR>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<BR>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<BR>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<BR>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<BR>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<BR>rights.<BR><BR>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<BR>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<BR>distribute and/or modify the software.<BR><BR>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<BR>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<BR>authors' reputations.<BR><BR>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<BR>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<BR>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<BR>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR> <BR>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<BR>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<BR>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<BR>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<BR>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<BR>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<BR>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<BR>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<BR><BR>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR><BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<BR>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>along with the Program.<BR><BR>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<BR><BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>    parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<BR>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<BR>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<BR>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<BR>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<BR>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<BR>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<BR>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<BR> <BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Program.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<BR>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<BR>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<BR>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<BR>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<BR>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<BR><BR>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<BR>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<BR>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<BR>itself accompanies the executable.<BR><BR>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR> <BR>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<BR>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Program or works based on it.<BR><BR>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR> <BR>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<BR>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<BR>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<BR>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<BR>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<BR>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<BR>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<BR>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.<BR><BR>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<BR>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<BR>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>			    NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<BR>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<BR>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<BR>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<BR>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<BR>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<BR>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<BR>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR> <BR>	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<BR>Public License instead of this License.<BR><BR><BR>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 2.1, February 1999<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>	51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<BR> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<BR> the version number 2.1.]<BR><BR>                            Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR><BR>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<BR>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<BR>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<BR>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<BR>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<BR>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations<BR>below.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<BR>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<BR>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<BR>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<BR>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<BR>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<BR>these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<BR>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<BR>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<BR>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<BR>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<BR>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<BR>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR><BR>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<BR>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<BR>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<BR>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<BR>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<BR>introduced by others.<BR> <BR>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<BR>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<BR>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<BR>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<BR>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<BR>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<BR><BR>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<BR>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<BR>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<BR>libraries into non-free programs.<BR><BR>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<BR>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<BR>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<BR>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<BR>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<BR>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<BR>the library.<BR><BR>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<BR>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<BR>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<BR>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<BR>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<BR>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<BR>special circumstances.<BR><BR>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<BR>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it<BR>becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must<BR>be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<BR>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<BR>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<BR>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<BR>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<BR>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<BR>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<BR>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<BR>system.<BR><BR>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<BR>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<BR>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<BR>that program using a modified version of the Library.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<BR>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<BR>be combined with the library in order to run.<BR> <BR>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<BR>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<BR>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<BR>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<BR>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<BR><BR>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR><BR>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<BR>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<BR><BR>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control<BR>compilation and installation of the library.<BR><BR>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR><BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<BR>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>fee.<BR> <BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR><BR>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Library.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>these notices.<BR> <BR>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR><BR>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR><BR>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<BR>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<BR>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<BR>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR><BR>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<BR>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR><BR>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR><BR>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR> <BR>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<BR>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<BR>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR><BR>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>of these things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<BR>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>    to use the modified definitions.)<BR><BR>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<BR>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<BR>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<BR>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<BR>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<BR>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<BR><BR>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least<BR>    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in<BR>    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of<BR>    performing this distribution.<BR><BR>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>    specified materials from the same place.<BR><BR>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR><BR>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<BR>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<BR>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>the executable.<BR><BR>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>distribute.<BR> <BR>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>    Sections above.<BR><BR>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Library or works based on it.<BR><BR>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<BR>this License.<BR> <BR>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License<BR>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those<BR>countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<BR>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<BR>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.<BR> <BR>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>                            NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<BR>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.

You can do so by permitting<BR>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms<BR>of the ordinary General Public License).<BR><BR>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.<BR>It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most<BR>effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should<BR>have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full<BR>notice is found.<BR><BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<BR>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Additional Definitions. <BR><BR>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<BR>General Public License.<BR><BR>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<BR>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<BR><BR>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<BR>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<BR>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<BR>of using an interface provided by the Library.<BR><BR>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<BR>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<BR>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<BR>Version".<BR><BR>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<BR>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<BR>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<BR>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<BR>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<BR>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<BR>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<BR><BR>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<BR>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<BR><BR>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<BR>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<BR>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<BR>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<BR>version:<BR><BR>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<BR>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<BR>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<BR>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<BR><BR>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<BR>   this License applicable to that copy.<BR><BR>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<BR><BR>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<BR>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<BR>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<BR>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<BR>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<BR>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<BR>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>  4. Combined Works.<BR><BR>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<BR>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<BR>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<BR>the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<BR>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<BR>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<BR>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<BR>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<BR><BR>   d) Do one of the following:<BR><BR>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<BR>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<BR>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<BR>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<BR>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<BR>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<BR>       Corresponding Source.<BR><BR>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<BR>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<BR>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<BR>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<BR>       Version. <BR><BR>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<BR>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<BR>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<BR>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<BR>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<BR>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<BR>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<BR>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<BR>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<BR>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<BR>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<BR><BR>  5. Combined Libraries.<BR><BR>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<BR>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<BR>choice, if you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<BR>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<BR>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<BR>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<BR>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<BR>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<BR>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<BR>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<BR>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<BR>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<BR>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<BR>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<BR>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<BR>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<BR>Library.<BR><BR><BR>Component gcc/libbacktrace:<BR>----------------------------<BR><BR><BR>The libbacktrace library<BR>Initially written by Ian Lance Taylor &ltiant@google.com><BR><BR>The libbacktrace library may be linked into a program or library and <BR>used to produce symbolic backtraces.  Sample uses would be to print a<BR>detailed backtrace when an error occurs or to gather detailed<BR>profiling information.<BR><BR>The libbacktrace library is provided under a BSD license.  See the <BR>source files for the exact license text.<BR><BR>The public functions are declared and documented in the header file<BR>backtrace.h, which should be #include'd by a user of the library.<BR><BR>Building libbacktrace will generate a file backtrace-supported.h,<BR>which a user of the library may use to determine whether backtraces<BR>will work.  See the source file backtrace-supported.h.in for the <BR>macros that it defines.<BR><BR>As of September 2012, libbacktrace only supports ELF executables with<BR>DWARF debugging information.

By contrast,<BR>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.<BR><BR>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<BR><BR>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous versions.<BR><BR>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<BR><BR>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>  0. Definitions.<BR><BR>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<BR><BR>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as semiconductor masks.<BR><BR>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<BR><BR>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<BR><BR>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the Program.<BR><BR>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<BR><BR>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<BR><BR>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<BR><BR>  1. Source Code.<BR><BR>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a work.<BR><BR>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers working in that language.<BR><BR>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the work.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same work.<BR><BR>  2. Basic Permissions.<BR><BR>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<BR><BR>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<BR><BR>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it unnecessary.<BR><BR>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<BR><BR>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.<BR><BR>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.<BR><BR>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<BR><BR>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<BR><BR>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<BR><BR>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<BR>    it, and giving a relevant date.<BR><BR>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<BR>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<BR>    "keep intact all notices".<BR><BR>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<BR>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<BR>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<BR>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<BR>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<BR><BR>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<BR>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<BR>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<BR>    work need not make them do so.<BR><BR>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<BR>parts of the aggregate.<BR><BR>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:<BR><BR>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<BR>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<BR>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<BR>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<BR>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<BR>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<BR>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<BR><BR>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<BR>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<BR>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>    with subsection 6b.<BR><BR>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<BR>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<BR>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<BR>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<BR>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<BR>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<BR>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<BR>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<BR>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<BR><BR>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<BR>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<BR>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<BR>    charge under subsection 6d.<BR><BR>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying the object code work.<BR><BR>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.<BR><BR>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.<BR><BR>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<BR>been installed in ROM).<BR><BR>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<BR>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across the network.<BR><BR>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<BR>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<BR>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<BR>unpacking, reading or copying.<BR><BR>  7. Additional Terms.<BR><BR>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<BR><BR>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<BR><BR>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<BR>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<BR><BR>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<BR>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<BR>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<BR><BR>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<BR>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<BR>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<BR><BR>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<BR>    authors of the material; or<BR><BR>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<BR>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<BR><BR>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<BR>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<BR>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<BR>    those licensors and authors.<BR><BR>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<BR><BR>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable terms.<BR><BR>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements apply either way.<BR><BR>  8. Termination.<BR><BR>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 11).<BR><BR>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<BR><BR>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.<BR><BR>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 10.<BR><BR>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<BR><BR>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<BR>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<BR><BR>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<BR><BR>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<BR><BR>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<BR><BR>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<BR>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<BR><BR>  11. Patents.<BR><BR>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<BR>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<BR><BR>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<BR><BR>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the party.<BR><BR>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<BR><BR>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<BR>work and works based on it.<BR><BR>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<BR><BR>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<BR><BR>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<BR><BR>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<BR><BR>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.<BR><BR>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<BR>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the Program.<BR><BR>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.<BR><BR>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<BR><BR>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<BR>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<BR>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<BR>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<BR>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<BR>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. Limitation of Liability.<BR><BR>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<BR>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<BR>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<BR>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<BR>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<BR>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<BR>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<BR>SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<BR><BR>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<BR>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<BR>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<BR>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<BR>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<BR>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<BR>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    &ltprogram>  Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<BR>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<BR><BR>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<BR>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<BR>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<BR>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<BR>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<BR>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.<BR><BR>		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lthttp://fsf.org/><BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR><BR>  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<BR>the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<BR>License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<BR><BR>  0. Additional Definitions. <BR><BR>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<BR>General Public License.<BR><BR>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<BR>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<BR><BR>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<BR>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<BR>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<BR>of using an interface provided by the Library.<BR><BR>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<BR>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<BR>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<BR>Version".<BR><BR>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<BR>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<BR>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<BR>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<BR>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<BR>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<BR>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<BR><BR>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<BR>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<BR><BR>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<BR>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<BR>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<BR>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<BR>version:<BR><BR>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<BR>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<BR>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<BR>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<BR><BR>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<BR>   this License applicable to that copy.<BR><BR>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<BR><BR>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<BR>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<BR>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<BR>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<BR>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<BR>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<BR>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>  4. Combined Works.<BR><BR>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<BR>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<BR>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<BR>the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<BR>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<BR>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<BR>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<BR>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<BR><BR>   d) Do one of the following:<BR><BR>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<BR>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<BR>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<BR>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<BR>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<BR>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<BR>       Corresponding Source.<BR><BR>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<BR>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<BR>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<BR>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<BR>       Version. <BR><BR>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<BR>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<BR>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<BR>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<BR>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<BR>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<BR>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<BR>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<BR>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<BR>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<BR>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<BR><BR>  5. Combined Libraries.<BR><BR>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<BR>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<BR>choice, if you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<BR>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<BR>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<BR>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<BR>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<BR>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<BR>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<BR>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<BR>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<BR>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<BR>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<BR>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<BR>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<BR>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 2, June 1991<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<BR> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>                            Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<BR>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<BR>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<BR>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<BR>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<BR>the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<BR>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<BR>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<BR>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<BR>rights.<BR><BR>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<BR>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<BR>distribute and/or modify the software.<BR><BR>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<BR>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<BR>authors' reputations.<BR><BR>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<BR>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<BR>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<BR>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<BR>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<BR>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<BR>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<BR>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<BR>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<BR>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<BR>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<BR><BR>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR><BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<BR>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>along with the Program.<BR><BR>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<BR><BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>    parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<BR>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<BR>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<BR>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<BR>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<BR>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<BR>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<BR>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Program.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<BR>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<BR>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<BR>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<BR>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<BR>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<BR><BR>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<BR>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<BR>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<BR>itself accompanies the executable.<BR><BR>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<BR>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Program or works based on it.<BR><BR>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<BR>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<BR>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<BR>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<BR>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<BR>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<BR>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<BR>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.<BR><BR>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<BR>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<BR>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>                            NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<BR>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<BR>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<BR>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<BR>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<BR>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<BR>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<BR>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<BR>    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<BR>    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<BR>when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<BR>    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.

If your program is a subroutine library, you may<BR>consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<BR>library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.<BR><BR>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lthttp://fsf.org/><BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>                            Preamble<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<BR>software and other kinds of works.<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<BR>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<BR>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.<BR><BR>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<BR><BR>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous versions.<BR><BR>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<BR><BR>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>  0. Definitions.<BR><BR>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<BR><BR>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as semiconductor masks.<BR><BR>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<BR><BR>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<BR><BR>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the Program.<BR><BR>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<BR><BR>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<BR><BR>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<BR><BR>  1. Source Code.<BR><BR>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a work.<BR><BR>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers working in that language.<BR><BR>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the work.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same work.<BR><BR>  2. Basic Permissions.<BR><BR>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<BR><BR>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<BR><BR>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it unnecessary.<BR><BR>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<BR><BR>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.<BR><BR>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.<BR><BR>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<BR><BR>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<BR><BR>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<BR><BR>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<BR>    it, and giving a relevant date.<BR><BR>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<BR>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<BR>    "keep intact all notices".<BR><BR>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<BR>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<BR>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<BR>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<BR>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<BR><BR>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<BR>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<BR>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<BR>    work need not make them do so.<BR><BR>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<BR>parts of the aggregate.<BR><BR>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:<BR><BR>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<BR>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<BR>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<BR>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<BR>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<BR>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<BR>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<BR><BR>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<BR>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<BR>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>    with subsection 6b.<BR><BR>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<BR>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<BR>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<BR>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<BR>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<BR>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<BR>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<BR>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<BR>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<BR><BR>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<BR>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<BR>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<BR>    charge under subsection 6d.<BR><BR>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying the object code work.<BR><BR>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.<BR><BR>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.<BR><BR>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<BR>been installed in ROM).<BR><BR>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<BR>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across the network.<BR><BR>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<BR>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<BR>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<BR>unpacking, reading or copying.<BR><BR>  7. Additional Terms.<BR><BR>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<BR><BR>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<BR><BR>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<BR>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<BR><BR>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<BR>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<BR>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<BR><BR>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<BR>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<BR>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<BR><BR>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<BR>    authors of the material; or<BR><BR>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<BR>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<BR><BR>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<BR>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<BR>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<BR>    those licensors and authors.<BR><BR>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<BR><BR>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable terms.<BR><BR>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements apply either way.<BR><BR>  8. Termination.<BR><BR>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 11).<BR><BR>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<BR><BR>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.<BR><BR>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 10.<BR><BR>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<BR><BR>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<BR>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<BR><BR>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<BR><BR>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<BR><BR>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<BR><BR>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<BR>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<BR><BR>  11. Patents.<BR><BR>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<BR>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<BR><BR>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<BR><BR>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the party.<BR><BR>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<BR><BR>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<BR>work and works based on it.<BR><BR>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<BR><BR>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<BR><BR>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<BR><BR>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<BR><BR>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.<BR><BR>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<BR>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the Program.<BR><BR>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.<BR><BR>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<BR><BR>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<BR>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<BR>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<BR>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<BR>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<BR>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. Limitation of Liability.<BR><BR>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<BR>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<BR>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<BR>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<BR>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<BR>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<BR>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<BR>SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<BR><BR>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<BR>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<BR>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<BR>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<BR>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<BR>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<BR>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    &ltprogram>  Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<BR>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<BR><BR>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<BR>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<BR>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<BR>&lthttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<BR>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<BR>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<BR>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.

It is<BR> numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<BR><BR>			    Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR><BR>  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<BR>specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<BR>other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<BR>your libraries, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<BR>you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<BR>complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<BR>with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<BR>the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<BR>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR><BR>  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<BR>version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<BR>the original authors' reputations.<BR> <BR>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<BR>software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<BR>transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<BR>we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<BR>free use or not licensed at all.<BR><BR>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<BR>GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<BR>license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<BR>designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<BR>one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<BR>the same as in the ordinary license.<BR><BR>  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<BR>they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<BR>program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<BR>changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<BR>analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<BR>a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<BR>derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<BR>treats it as such.<BR><BR>  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<BR>Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<BR>sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<BR>concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<BR><BR>  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<BR>users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<BR>libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<BR>permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<BR>preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<BR>libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<BR>this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<BR>changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<BR>will lead to faster development of free libraries.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<BR>former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<BR>works together with the library.<BR><BR>  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<BR>General Public License rather than by this special one.<BR> <BR>		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<BR>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<BR>party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<BR>General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<BR>addressed as "you".<BR><BR>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR><BR>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<BR>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<BR><BR>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>and installation of the library.<BR><BR>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR>  <BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<BR>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>fee.<BR> <BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR><BR>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Library.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>these notices.<BR> <BR>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR><BR>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR><BR>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<BR>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<BR>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<BR>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR><BR>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<BR>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR><BR>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR><BR>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR> <BR>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<BR>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<BR>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR><BR>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>of these things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<BR>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>    to use the modified definitions.)<BR><BR>    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR><BR>    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>    specified materials from the same place.<BR><BR>    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR><BR>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<BR>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<BR>distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>the executable.<BR><BR>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>distribute.<BR> <BR>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>    Sections above.<BR><BR>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Library or works based on it.<BR><BR>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this License.<BR> <BR>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<BR>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.<BR> <BR>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>			    NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<BR>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<BR>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<BR>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<BR>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<BR>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<BR>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<BR>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<BR>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<BR>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<BR>DAMAGES.<BR><BR>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR> <BR>           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR><BR>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>ordinary General Public License).<BR><BR>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<BR>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast,<BR>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.<BR><BR>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<BR><BR>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous versions.<BR><BR>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<BR><BR>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>  0. Definitions.<BR><BR>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<BR><BR>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as semiconductor masks.<BR><BR>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<BR><BR>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<BR><BR>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the Program.<BR><BR>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<BR><BR>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<BR><BR>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<BR><BR>  1. Source Code.<BR><BR>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a work.<BR><BR>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers working in that language.<BR><BR>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the work.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same work.<BR><BR>  2. Basic Permissions.<BR><BR>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<BR><BR>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<BR><BR>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it unnecessary.<BR><BR>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<BR><BR>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.<BR><BR>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.<BR><BR>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<BR><BR>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<BR><BR>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<BR><BR>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<BR>    it, and giving a relevant date.<BR><BR>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<BR>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<BR>    "keep intact all notices".<BR><BR>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<BR>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<BR>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<BR>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<BR>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<BR><BR>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<BR>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<BR>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<BR>    work need not make them do so.<BR><BR>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<BR>parts of the aggregate.<BR><BR>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:<BR><BR>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<BR>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<BR>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<BR>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<BR>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<BR>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<BR>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<BR><BR>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<BR>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<BR>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>    with subsection 6b.<BR><BR>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<BR>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<BR>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<BR>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<BR>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<BR>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<BR>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<BR>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<BR>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<BR><BR>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<BR>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<BR>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<BR>    charge under subsection 6d.<BR><BR>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying the object code work.<BR><BR>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.<BR><BR>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.<BR><BR>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<BR>been installed in ROM).<BR><BR>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<BR>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across the network.<BR><BR>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<BR>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<BR>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<BR>unpacking, reading or copying.<BR><BR>  7. Additional Terms.<BR><BR>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<BR><BR>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<BR><BR>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<BR>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<BR><BR>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<BR>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<BR>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<BR><BR>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<BR>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<BR>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<BR><BR>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<BR>    authors of the material; or<BR><BR>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<BR>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<BR><BR>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<BR>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<BR>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<BR>    those licensors and authors.<BR><BR>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<BR><BR>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable terms.<BR><BR>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements apply either way.<BR><BR>  8. Termination.<BR><BR>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 11).<BR><BR>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<BR><BR>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.<BR><BR>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 10.<BR><BR>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<BR><BR>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<BR>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<BR><BR>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<BR><BR>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<BR><BR>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<BR><BR>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<BR>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<BR><BR>  11. Patents.<BR><BR>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<BR>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<BR><BR>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<BR><BR>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the party.<BR><BR>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<BR><BR>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<BR>work and works based on it.<BR><BR>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<BR><BR>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<BR><BR>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<BR><BR>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<BR><BR>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.<BR><BR>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<BR>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the Program.<BR><BR>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.<BR><BR>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<BR><BR>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<BR>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<BR>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<BR>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<BR>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<BR>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. Limitation of Liability.<BR><BR>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<BR>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<BR>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<BR>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<BR>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<BR>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<BR>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<BR>SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<BR><BR>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<BR>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<BR>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<BR>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<BR>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<BR>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<BR>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    &ltprogram>  Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<BR>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<BR><BR>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<BR>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<BR>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<BR>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<BR>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<BR>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.<BR><BR>		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>		       Version 2, June 1991<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<BR> numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<BR><BR>			    Preamble<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR><BR>  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<BR>specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<BR>other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<BR>your libraries, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<BR>you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<BR>complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<BR>with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<BR>the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<BR>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR><BR>  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<BR>version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<BR>the original authors' reputations.<BR> <BR>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<BR>software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<BR>transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<BR>we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<BR>free use or not licensed at all.<BR><BR>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<BR>GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<BR>license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<BR>designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<BR>one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<BR>the same as in the ordinary license.<BR><BR>  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<BR>they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<BR>program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<BR>changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<BR>analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<BR>a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<BR>derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<BR>treats it as such.<BR><BR>  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<BR>Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<BR>sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<BR>concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<BR><BR>  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<BR>users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<BR>libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<BR>permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<BR>preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<BR>libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<BR>this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<BR>changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<BR>will lead to faster development of free libraries.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<BR>former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<BR>works together with the library.<BR><BR>  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<BR>General Public License rather than by this special one.<BR> <BR>		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<BR>contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<BR>party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<BR>General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is<BR>addressed as "you".<BR><BR>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR><BR>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<BR>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<BR><BR>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>and installation of the library.<BR><BR>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR>  <BR>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<BR>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>Library.<BR><BR>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>fee.<BR> <BR>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR><BR>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR><BR>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>it.<BR><BR>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Library.<BR><BR>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>these notices.<BR> <BR>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR><BR>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR><BR>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<BR>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR><BR>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<BR>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<BR>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR><BR>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<BR>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR><BR>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR><BR>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR> <BR>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<BR>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<BR>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR><BR>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>of these things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<BR>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>    to use the modified definitions.)<BR><BR>    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR><BR>    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>    specified materials from the same place.<BR><BR>    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR><BR>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<BR>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<BR>distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>the executable.<BR><BR>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>distribute.<BR> <BR>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR><BR>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>    Sections above.<BR><BR>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the Library or works based on it.<BR><BR>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this License.<BR> <BR>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<BR>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation.<BR> <BR>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>			    NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<BR>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<BR>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<BR>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<BR>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<BR>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<BR>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<BR>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<BR>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<BR>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<BR>DAMAGES.<BR><BR>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR> <BR>     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR><BR>  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>ordinary General Public License).<BR><BR>  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<BR>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Additional Definitions.<BR><BR>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<BR>General Public License.<BR><BR>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<BR>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<BR><BR>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<BR>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<BR>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<BR>of using an interface provided by the Library.<BR><BR>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<BR>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<BR>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<BR>Version".<BR><BR>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<BR>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<BR>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<BR>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<BR>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<BR>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<BR>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<BR><BR>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<BR>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<BR><BR>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<BR>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<BR>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<BR>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<BR>version:<BR><BR>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<BR>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<BR>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<BR>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<BR><BR>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<BR>   this License applicable to that copy.<BR><BR>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<BR><BR>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<BR>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<BR>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<BR>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<BR>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<BR>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<BR>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>  4. Combined Works.<BR><BR>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<BR>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<BR>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<BR>the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<BR>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<BR>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<BR>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<BR>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<BR><BR>   d) Do one of the following:<BR><BR>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<BR>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<BR>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<BR>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<BR>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<BR>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<BR>       Corresponding Source.<BR><BR>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<BR>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<BR>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<BR>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<BR>       Version.<BR><BR>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<BR>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<BR>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<BR>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<BR>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<BR>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<BR>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<BR>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<BR>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<BR>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<BR>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<BR><BR>  5. Combined Libraries.<BR><BR>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<BR>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<BR>choice, if you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<BR>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<BR>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<BR>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<BR>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<BR>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<BR>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<BR>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<BR>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<BR>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<BR>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<BR>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<BR>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<BR>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<BR>Library.<BR><BR><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR><BR>Contains code from project MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/) under the following<BR>license(s).<BR><BR>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lthttp://fsf.org/><BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR>                            Preamble<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<BR>software and other kinds of works.<BR><BR>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<BR>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<BR>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<BR>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<BR>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<BR>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<BR>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.<BR><BR>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<BR>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<BR>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<BR><BR>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<BR>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<BR>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<BR>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<BR><BR>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<BR>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<BR>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<BR>know their rights.<BR><BR>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<BR>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<BR>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<BR><BR>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<BR>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<BR>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<BR>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<BR>authors of previous versions.<BR><BR>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<BR>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<BR>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<BR>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<BR>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<BR>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<BR>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<BR>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<BR>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<BR>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<BR><BR>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<BR>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<BR>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<BR>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<BR>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<BR>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<BR><BR>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>  0. Definitions.<BR><BR>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<BR><BR>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<BR>works, such as semiconductor masks.<BR><BR>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<BR>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<BR>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<BR><BR>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<BR>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<BR>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<BR>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<BR><BR>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<BR>on the Program.<BR><BR>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<BR>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<BR>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<BR>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<BR>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<BR>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<BR><BR>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<BR>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<BR>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<BR><BR>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<BR>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<BR>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<BR>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<BR>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<BR>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<BR>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<BR>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<BR><BR>  1. Source Code.<BR><BR>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<BR>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<BR>form of a work.<BR><BR>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<BR>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<BR>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<BR>is widely used among developers working in that language.<BR><BR>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<BR>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<BR>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<BR>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<BR>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<BR>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<BR>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<BR>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<BR>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<BR>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<BR>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<BR>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<BR>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<BR>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<BR>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<BR>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<BR>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<BR>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<BR>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<BR>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<BR>subprograms and other parts of the work.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<BR>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<BR>Source.<BR><BR>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<BR>same work.<BR><BR>  2. Basic Permissions.<BR><BR>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<BR>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<BR>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<BR>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<BR>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<BR>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<BR>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<BR><BR>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<BR>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<BR>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<BR>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<BR>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<BR>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<BR>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<BR>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<BR>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<BR>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<BR><BR>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<BR>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<BR>makes it unnecessary.<BR><BR>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<BR><BR>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<BR>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<BR>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<BR>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<BR>measures.<BR><BR>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<BR>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<BR>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<BR>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<BR>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<BR>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<BR>technological measures.<BR><BR>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<BR><BR>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<BR>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<BR>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<BR>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<BR>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<BR>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<BR>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<BR>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<BR><BR>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<BR><BR>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<BR>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<BR>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<BR>    it, and giving a relevant date.<BR><BR>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<BR>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<BR>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<BR>    "keep intact all notices".<BR><BR>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<BR>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<BR>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<BR>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<BR>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<BR>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<BR>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<BR><BR>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<BR>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<BR>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<BR>    work need not make them do so.<BR><BR>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<BR>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<BR>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<BR>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<BR>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<BR>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<BR>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<BR>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<BR>parts of the aggregate.<BR><BR>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<BR>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<BR>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<BR>in one of these ways:<BR><BR>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<BR>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<BR>    customarily used for software interchange.<BR><BR>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<BR>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<BR>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<BR>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<BR>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<BR>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<BR>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<BR>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<BR>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<BR>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<BR><BR>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<BR>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<BR>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<BR>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<BR>    with subsection 6b.<BR><BR>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<BR>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<BR>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<BR>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<BR>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<BR>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<BR>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<BR>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<BR>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<BR>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<BR>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<BR>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<BR><BR>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<BR>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<BR>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<BR>    charge under subsection 6d.<BR><BR>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<BR>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<BR>included in conveying the object code work.<BR><BR>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<BR>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<BR>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<BR>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<BR>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<BR>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<BR>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<BR>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<BR>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<BR>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<BR>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<BR>the only significant mode of use of the product.<BR><BR>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<BR>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<BR>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<BR>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<BR>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<BR>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<BR>modification has been made.<BR><BR>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<BR>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<BR>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<BR>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<BR>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<BR>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<BR>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<BR>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<BR>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<BR>been installed in ROM).<BR><BR>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<BR>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<BR>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<BR>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<BR>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<BR>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<BR>protocols for communication across the network.<BR><BR>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<BR>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<BR>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<BR>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<BR>unpacking, reading or copying.<BR><BR>  7. Additional Terms.<BR><BR>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<BR>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<BR>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<BR>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<BR>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<BR>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<BR>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<BR>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<BR><BR>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<BR>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<BR>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<BR>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<BR>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<BR>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<BR>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<BR>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<BR><BR>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<BR>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<BR><BR>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<BR>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<BR>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<BR><BR>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<BR>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<BR>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<BR><BR>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<BR>    authors of the material; or<BR><BR>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<BR>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<BR><BR>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<BR>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<BR>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<BR>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<BR>    those licensors and authors.<BR><BR>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<BR>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<BR>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<BR>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<BR>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<BR>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<BR>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<BR>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<BR>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<BR><BR>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<BR>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<BR>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<BR>where to find the applicable terms.<BR><BR>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<BR>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<BR>the above requirements apply either way.<BR><BR>  8. Termination.<BR><BR>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<BR>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<BR>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<BR>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<BR>paragraph of section 11).<BR><BR>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<BR>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<BR>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<BR>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<BR>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<BR>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<BR><BR>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<BR>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<BR>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<BR>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<BR>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<BR>your receipt of the notice.<BR><BR>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<BR>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<BR>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<BR>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<BR>material under section 10.<BR><BR>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<BR><BR>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<BR>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<BR>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<BR>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<BR>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<BR>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<BR>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<BR>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<BR><BR>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<BR><BR>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<BR>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<BR>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<BR>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<BR><BR>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<BR>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<BR>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<BR>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<BR>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<BR>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<BR>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<BR>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<BR>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<BR><BR>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<BR>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<BR>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<BR>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<BR>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<BR>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<BR>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<BR><BR>  11. Patents.<BR><BR>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<BR>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<BR>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<BR><BR>  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<BR>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<BR>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<BR>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<BR>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<BR>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<BR>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<BR>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<BR>this License.<BR><BR>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<BR>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<BR>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<BR>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<BR><BR>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<BR>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<BR>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<BR>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<BR>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<BR>patent against the party.<BR><BR>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<BR>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<BR>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<BR>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<BR>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<BR>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<BR>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<BR>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<BR>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<BR>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<BR>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<BR>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<BR>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<BR><BR>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<BR>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<BR>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<BR>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<BR>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<BR>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<BR>work and works based on it.<BR><BR>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<BR>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<BR>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<BR>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<BR>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<BR>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<BR>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<BR>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<BR>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<BR>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<BR>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<BR>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<BR>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<BR>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<BR><BR>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<BR>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<BR>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<BR><BR>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<BR><BR>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<BR>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<BR>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<BR>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<BR>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<BR>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<BR><BR>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<BR><BR>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<BR>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<BR>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<BR>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<BR>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<BR>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<BR>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<BR>combination as such.<BR><BR>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<BR>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<BR>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<BR>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<BR>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<BR>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<BR>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<BR>by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<BR>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<BR>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<BR>to choose that version for the Program.<BR><BR>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<BR>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<BR>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<BR>later version.<BR><BR>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<BR><BR>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<BR>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<BR>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<BR>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<BR>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<BR>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>  16. Limitation of Liability.<BR><BR>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<BR>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<BR>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<BR>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<BR>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<BR>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<BR>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<BR>SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<BR><BR>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<BR>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<BR>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<BR>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<BR>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<BR>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<BR><BR>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR><BR>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR><BR>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><BR>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR><BR>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<BR>    (at your option) any later version.<BR><BR>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>    along with this program.  If not, see &lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR><BR>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<BR>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR><BR>    &ltprogram>  Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><BR>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<BR>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<BR><BR>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<BR>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<BR>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<BR><BR>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<BR>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<BR>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<BR>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<BR>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<BR>&lthttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.<BR><BR>		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<BR><BR> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lthttp://fsf.org/><BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR><BR><BR>  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<BR>the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<BR>License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<BR><BR>  0. Additional Definitions. <BR><BR>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<BR>General Public License.<BR><BR>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<BR>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<BR><BR>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<BR>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<BR>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<BR>of using an interface provided by the Library.<BR><BR>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<BR>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<BR>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<BR>Version".<BR><BR>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<BR>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<BR>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<BR>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<BR>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<BR>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<BR>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<BR><BR>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<BR>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<BR><BR>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<BR>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<BR>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<BR>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<BR>version:<BR><BR>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<BR>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<BR>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<BR>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<BR><BR>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<BR>   this License applicable to that copy.<BR><BR>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<BR><BR>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<BR>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<BR>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<BR>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<BR>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<BR>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<BR>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>  4. Combined Works.<BR><BR>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<BR>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<BR>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<BR>the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<BR>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<BR>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<BR>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<BR>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<BR><BR>   d) Do one of the following:<BR><BR>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<BR>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<BR>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<BR>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<BR>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<BR>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<BR>       Corresponding Source.<BR><BR>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<BR>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<BR>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<BR>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<BR>       Version. <BR><BR>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<BR>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<BR>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<BR>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<BR>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<BR>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<BR>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<BR>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<BR>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<BR>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<BR>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<BR><BR>  5. Combined Libraries.<BR><BR>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<BR>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<BR>choice, if you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<BR>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<BR>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<BR>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<BR>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<BR>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<BR>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<BR>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<BR>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<BR>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<BR>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<BR>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<BR>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<BR>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<BR>Library.<BR><BR><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR><BR>Contains code from project NEWLIB and LIBGLOSS (https://sourceware.org/newlib/)<BR>under the following license(s).<BR><BR>newlib:<BR>-------<BR><BR>The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.<BR><BR>Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source <BR>file.
